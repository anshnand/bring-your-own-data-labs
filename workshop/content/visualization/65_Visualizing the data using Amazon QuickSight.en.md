## Visualizing the data using Amazon QuickSight

Now that you have configured the data source and prepared the dataset to work with, we will
start by forecasting values in future dates based on your sample data.

### Forecast Monthly Trend for your Quantity Column

1. Under the **Fields list**, select your **Date** column for x-axis by clicking on the field name.
2. Change the visual type to a line chart by selecting the line chart icon highlighted in the screenshot below under **Visual types**.

At this point, the Y-axis of the visual will be populated automatically with count of records
that match each date individually. You can keep it that way and do forecasting for
**count of records**, or choose another **quantity attribute** from Fields list to populate
 Y-axis automatically and have more meaningful forecast.

Before viewing the forecast, you can choose the level of aggregation you want for your **date**
column to populate X-axis by year, month or day. 

3. Click on the **date** field name in top **Field Wells** bar to reveal a sub-menu.
4. Select **Aggregate:Month** to aggregate by month.

You can also use the slider on the X-axis to select the range of values to appear in the graph.

If you receive an error, try to use **Forecast properties** panel that opens at left, customizing **Periods backward** value to match your number of data points.

**NOTE:** Make sure your Y-axis is assigned to a quantity column before proceeding.

### Adding Filters

You can apply filters to both regular and calculated fields, which include text, numeric, and date fields.
Let's apply a date filter:

1. Choose **Filter** on the tool bar.
2. On the **Applied filters** pane, choose **Create one**, and then choose a date field to filter on.
