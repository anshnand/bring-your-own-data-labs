<!---You can duplicate an existing data set to save a copy of it with a new name. The new data set is a completely separate copy.  Choose **Duplicate** data set, and enter a name for the copy.--->

2. We suggest that you pick two - three columns from your data set that meet the following criteria:
  * The first column is a date column (can be year, month or day. Usually marked by **calendar icon**
in **Fields list** on the left)
  * The second column is a quantifiable number (revenue, count, distance, etc. Usually
marked by a **green hash #**)
  * The third column has categorical value, which means it has specific limited set of values (type,
category, etc. Usually marked by **ticket icon**)

3. Optional - Change the data type. You can change the field's data type in one of the available data types.
